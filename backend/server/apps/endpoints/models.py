from django.db import models

# We defined three models:

#     Endpoint - to keep information about our endpoints,
#     MLAlgorithm - to keep information about ML algorithms used in the service,
#     MLAlgorithmStatus - to keep information about ML algorithm statuses. The status can change in time, for example, we can set testing as initial status and then after testing period switch to production state.
#     MLRequest - to keep information about all requests to ML algorithms. It will be needed to monitor ML algorithms and run A/B tests.

# We need to add our app to INSTALLED_APPS in backend/server/server/settings.py, it should look like:

# Create your models here.
