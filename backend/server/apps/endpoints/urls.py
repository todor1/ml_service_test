OK, letâ€™s go into details. The PredictView accepts only POST requests. It is available at:


The `endpoint_name` is defining the endpoint that we are trying to reach. In our case (in local development) the ML algorithm can be accessed at:

```http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/income_classifier/predict```

The `income_classifier` is the endpoint name (you can check endpoints at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/endpoints`).

What is more, you can specify algorithm status or version in the URL. To specify status and version you need to include them in the URL, for example:

```http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/income_classifier/predict?status=testing&version=1.1.1```.

By default, there is a used `production` status.

Based on endpoint name, status and version there is routing of the request to correct ML algorithm. If the algorithm is selected properly, the JSON request is forwarded to the algorithm object and prediction is computed.

In the code there is also included code that is drawing algorithm in case A/B testing, we will go into details of this code in the next chapter.

To check if is it working please go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/income_classifier/predict` and provide example JSON input:

```python
{
    "age": 37,
    "workclass": "Private",
    "fnlwgt": 34146,
    "education": "HS-grad",
    "education-num": 9,
    "marital-status": "Married-civ-spouse",
    "occupation": "Craft-repair",
    "relationship": "Husband",
    "race": "White",
    "sex": "Male",
    "capital-gain": 0,
    "capital-loss": 0,
    "hours-per-week": 68,
    "native-country": "United-States"
}

and click the POST button. You should see views like in images below.
